#### _posts

Where the book chapters are placed

#### _includes, _layouts, css, _sass

Jekyll stuff. You can ignore this unless you know Jekyll and can change the templates.

#### _site

When Jekyll generates the site, it places it in this directory. Everything in here is generated, therefore changes will not be persistent and will be overwritten next time the site is generated.
